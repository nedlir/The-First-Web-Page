A 2021 reimagination of the first web page

# What is this? #
A modern reimagination of the [first web page](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)

# To Do #
* Create static webpage. 
* Add fun functionality with javascript libraries (the more the merrier). 
* Design it with css (again, the more frameworks, the merrier). 
* Make sure the page is compatible on all devices like your smart fridge. 
* Build a reliable database. 
* Make sure there's enough time to make coffee while the page loads. 
* Drink coffee.
